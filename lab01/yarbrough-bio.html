<title> Jay Yarbrough-Bio</title>
</head>

<body>
    My name is Jay Yarbrough. I am an Information management and technology major at Syracuse university ISchool. I have a focus in Cyber security and my interest is both system hardening and cyber management. 
While studding in my field I have received a certificate of completion validated by the NSA for taking and completing several cyber security focused courses. Furthermore, while completing my degree I was commissioned as an officer in the United States Army. My current role is the signal specialist for the Army. 
In regards to my hobbies; I am a devout follower of sport fencing and often practice at least three times a week trying to perfect my craft. I am also interested in science fiction especially if it is Star Wars/ star gate related.
